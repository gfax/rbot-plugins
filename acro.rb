# Acrophobia - Submit backronyms and vote on the best!

# TODO: Wow this plugin is very hackish. Definitely need to redo some things.
# FIXME: Fix stats and hall of fame.
# FIXME: Currently only works in one channel at a time since people /msg the
# bot with suggestions and votes. Any possible work-arounds?
